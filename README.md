# ASK
ASK (Asas Sains Komputer) or Basic of Computer Science is a mobile application using game-based learning algorithm. This is a quiz game which contains two topics from ASK for 13 years old students. It is created for my Final Year Project (FYP) in program Bachelor of Computer Science (HONORS).
